The male Hen Harrier is a striking grey and white bird with black wingtips. I've spotted at least two Hen Harrier couples nesting near my cabin in the mountains. In my opinion, it's one of the most beautiful bird of prey in Scandinavia.

#### 2025

On July 11, 2025, we had the chance to band two young Hen Harriers. I've attached pictures of the dad and the nest from that year. It's not easy to find Hen Harrier nests, so it's crucial to spend as much time as possible in the area where they're nesting. Keep an eye out and observe their behavior closely.

#### 2024

In late May 2024, I saw the female Hen Harrier busy building a nest. Around mid-June, I observed the male returning with prey, which he then delivered to the female.

In July 2024, I joined a licensed bird bander to band the young ones. We checked the nest in the first week of July and found one chick and three eggs. Unfortunately, the chick was too small to get a band, so we decided to return the following week. The second week of July, we approached the nest again for banding. But sadly, a predator, probably a fox, attacked the nest. Nature can be brutal, I suppose. I also saw the male Hen Harrier returning with chicks that he had caught for food and delivered to the female.

#### General

The Hen Harrier is critically endangered in Norway. According to official numbers, there are only about a hundred couples nesting in the country.
