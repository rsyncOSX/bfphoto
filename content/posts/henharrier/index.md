The male Hen Harrier is grey and white with black wingtips. There is at least two Hen Harrier couple nesting close to my cabin in the mountains. In my opinion, the Hen Harrier is one of the most beautiful bird of prey in Scandinavia.

#### 2025

On 11 July, 2025, we managed to band two young Hen Harrier. In pictures below, under 2025, there are pcictures of the dad of the young ones and from the nest.

#### 2024

In late May 2024, I observed the female building a nest. And about mid-June 2024 I observed the male returning with prey delivering it to the female.

In July 2024 I was joining a licensed bird bander for banding the young ones. We checked the nest in the first week of July and there was one chick and three eggs. The chick was at that time too small to get a band and we decided to return for banding one week later. The second week of July 2024 we approached the nest again for banding. But very sadly a predator, most likely a fox, has attacked the nest. This is how nature is, brutal. I also observed the male Hen Harrier returning with chicks that he had caught for eating and delivering to the female.

General

The Hen Harrier is critically endangered in Norway. According to official numbers, there are only about a hundred couples in Norway.
